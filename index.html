            <p>
              Players are awakened by the iconic "Pink Soldiers" melody blasting
              through the speakers. The haunting tune serves as a daily reminder
              of their new reality.

            <p>
              Players line up in the dining area to receive their standardized
              meal. The food is simple but sufficient - rice, soup, and a
              protein. Every player gets the exact same portion, another
              reminder of the enforced equality inside the facility.

            <p>
              The masked staff members gather all players in the main hall. The
              Front Man assistant announces today's game through the speakers.
              Players are not told what specific game they'll be playing until
              they arrive at the venue - adding to their anxiety and fear.

            <p>
              Players are escorted to the game venue. The tension is palpable as
              they walk through the colorful stairways, uncertain of what awaits
              them. Some pray, others strategize, many remain silent with fear.

            <p>
              "Let The game begins!" The rules are explained only moments before
              start. Here is an example of the rules,

                >download it here</a
              >
              to review before participating. Players must use their wits,
              physical abilities, and sometimes form alliances to survive. Each
              game is designed to eliminate players - there's no room for
              everyone to succeed.
            </p>
            <div class="warning-box">
              <h3>⚠️ Elimination Warning</h3>
              <p>
                Players who fail to complete the game or break the rules are
                immediately eliminated from the competition. In Squid Game,
                elimination means death.

              After the morning game, surviving players are provided lunch. The

              make it through the last game.

              Players are given a few hours of free time in the dormitory. Some
              use this time to form alliances, others to rest. Strategic players
              observe their competition, looking for weaknesses or potential
              allies.

              The final meal of the day is served. The atmosphere varies
              dramatically depending on the day's events - sometimes quiet
              reflection, other times tense with conflict or strategy

            <p>
              The facility goes dark. Guards remain on duty, monitoring players
              at all times. Sleep is difficult for many, haunted by the day's
              events and anxiety about tomorrow's game. The most dangerous time
              in the dormitory - when the darkness allows for hidden conflicts
              to emerge.
