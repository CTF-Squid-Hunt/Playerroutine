            <h2>Wake-Up Call</h2>
            <p>
              Players are awakened by the iconic "Pink Soldiers" melody blasting
              through the speakers. The haunting tune serves as a daily reminder
              of their new reality.

            <p>
              Players line up in the dining area to receive their standardized
              meal. The food is simple but sufficient - rice, soup, and a
              protein. Every player gets the exact same portion, another
              reminder of the enforced equality inside the facility.

            <p>
              The masked staff members gather all players in the main hall. The
              Front Man announces today's game through the speakers. Players are
              not told what specific game they'll be playing until they arrive
              at the venue - adding to their anxiety and fear.

            <h2>Preparation</h2>
            <p>
              Players are escorted to the game venue. The tension is palpable as
              they walk through the colorful stairways, uncertain of what awaits
              them. Some pray, others strategize, many remain silent with fear.

            <h2>Game Time</h2>
            <p>
              The game begins. The rules are explained only moments before
              start. Players must use their wits, physical abilities, and
              sometimes form alliances to survive. Each game is designed to
              eliminate players - there's no room for everyone to succeed.
            </p>
            <div class="warning-box">
              <h3>⚠️ Elimination Warning</h3>
              <p>
                Players who fail to complete the game or break the rules are
                immediately eliminated from the competition. In Squid Game,
                elimination means death.

            <h2>Lunch Break</h2>
            <p>
              After the morning game, surviving players are provided lunch. The
              empty spots at the tables are stark reminders of those who didn't
              make it through the last game.

            <p>
              Players are given a few hours of free time in the dormitory. Some
              use this time to form alliances, others to rest. Strategic players
              observe their competition, looking for weaknesses or potential
              allies.

            <p>
              The final meal of the day is served. The atmosphere varies
              dramatically depending on the day's events - sometimes quiet
              reflection, other times tense with conflict or strategy
              discussions.

            <h2>Lights Out</h2>
            <p>
              The facility goes dark. Guards remain on duty, monitoring players
              at all times. Sleep is difficult for many, haunted by the day's
              events and anxiety about tomorrow's game. The most dangerous time
              in the dormitory - when the darkness allows for hidden conflicts
              to emerge.
